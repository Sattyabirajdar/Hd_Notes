## About The Project  
**HD Notes** is a full-stack web application built with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. It enables users to create, view, edit, and organize high-definition notes with embedded images support.

---

## Demo  
*(Include a link to a deployed version if available)*  
Example: [Live Demo here](YOUR_DEPLOYED_URL_HERE)

---

## Tech Stack  
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing notes and attachments  
- **Express.js** – Backend framework for RESTful APIs  
- **React** – Frontend UI library  
- **Node.js** – Server runtime environment  
- **Mongoose** – ODM for MongoDB schemas and queries  
- **Concurrency** – Concurrently or npm scripts to run client & server together

---

## Architecture  
- **Backend (server/)**  
  - Express app exposing REST endpoints (e.g. `GET /notes`, `POST /notes`, etc.)  
  - MongoDB models defined with Mongoose  
  - Middleware for validation, CORS, error handling  

- **Frontend (client/)**  
  - React app (created via CRA or Vite)  
  - Components for listing notes, editing, searching  
  - Image upload and embedding  

- **Folder Structure**
